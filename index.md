This is a site by a bored-at-work kids are grown mid-life grease monkey just entertaining myself by attempting to learn new things from around the Internets.

* jekyll 
    
    I tried to make this site using only html and css, but that sucked.  More likely my brain isn't logical enough to abstract all the features I thought I wanted.
    So I tried [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because it seemed to have nice abstractions and features, but there was too much magic for my taste.
    But then I learned most of the "magic" was actually being done by the `minima` theme and not jekyll itself. So I made a blank jekyll site, and here we are.


* p5.js sketching

    I have made some "sketches" on the p5.js site.  I thought I'd try to make a gallery here using jekyll.
